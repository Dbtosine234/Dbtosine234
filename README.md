What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering pertains to building and developing intangible products for today's modern world. We routinely use software to accomplish everyday tasks like online banking, messaging friends, storing files in the cloud, and so much more which an engineer built. If you've been wondering how to learn software engineering, you've come to the right place!

<h2>What is a Software Engineer?</h2>
<p>A software engineer is a person who designs, tests, maintains, and evaluates the software that they've built. Software engineers work with businesses, governments, hospitals, non-profits, and more organizations and companies to develop the software they need to run correctly.
